# confettiDJ

confettiDJ is an animation and sound game, created using Paper.js, howler.js 
and the sounds from the open source project Neuronal Synchrony.


# Play

Press any key, from A to Z, to create jingles and rotating confetti.


# Note

To get rid of the Cross Origin errors in the console, 
you'll need to run a local HTTP server from your project's directory,
and load the confettiDJ.html file from there.
